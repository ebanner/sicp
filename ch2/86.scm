;;; EXERCISE 2.86

;;; I gave up on this one.
;;;
;;; But in order for this to work, one would need to implement generic
;;; procedures for `sine', `cosine', `tangent', and `arctangent'. The
;;; accessors `real-part', `imaginary-part', `angle', and `magnitude'
;;; should use these generic procedures instead of the built-in scheme
;;; ones. We also need to change the procedures `add-complex',
;;; `sub-complex', `mul-complex', and `div-complex' to use the
;;; corresponding generic procedures instead of the scheme built-in ones.
