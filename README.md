## [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)

Here are solutions to exercises from the landmark text [Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), written
by [Gerald Jay Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman) and
[Harold Abelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson). I am indebted to
these legends for crafting such a fine text along with a set of
unforgettable [video
lectures.](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/)

Back when I was a freshman in college, I attempted to make my way through this
book. I immediately found most of the content too abstract and crushingly difficult
and abandoned the book after a short amount of time. It did, however, leave a
lasting impression on me. I thought at the time the material was important, even
though I couldn't grasp most of it.

With an undergraduate education in Computer Science under my belt I finally feel
like I'm up to the challenge of tackling this book. And, in fact, I have been
having having a much easier time this time around (and having a lot more fun!).

I am using various tools for Scheme development, primarily
[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with the
[Evil](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil) plugin (I find emacs totally
unusable with its default navigation keys), along with the
[mit-scheme](www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) package. Whenever I need extra
debugging capabilities (the emacs/mit-scheme debugger is terrible), I've been
using the debugger that comes with [The Racket Language](http://racket-lang.org/)
(which is really quite nice). I am using Neil Van Dyke's [Racket SICP
Package](http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket-sicp/). Sometimes I just want a
complete image of the reductions that have taken place up to a crash.  Despite
its paltry feature set, I've found the best tool for this to be the ancient
[Edwin
editor](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-user/Edwin.html)
Edwin ships with [mit-scheme](www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/), and it's the
editor the SICP class in the video lectures used!
